# ClassProjectSummaries
This repo will be used to summarize and present the projects that I have completed during my education 
They focus on explain the general idea of the project and some examples of the output. 
Since most projects end up being reused, I will not have the source code public, if you are intrested in seeing the source code 
please email me @ norma484@umn.edu and I will make you a contributor to the private repo.
